# Assembly Language Project

Welcome to the Assembly Language Project repository! This project showcases examples and implementations of various assembly language programs, aiming to provide a resource for learning and understanding low-level programming concepts.

I aim to provide help to every student undertaking the CSC401 course and provide them with necessary help in the laboratory classes. Classmates are welcomed to take help and contribute.

Every contribution is appreciated

## Introduction
Assembly language programming offers a deep dive into the fundamentals of computer architecture and low-level programming. This repository serves as a collection of assembly language programs and examples, demonstrating techniques, algorithms, and best practices for different architectures.

Here we write MIPS assembly code that are run inte MARS simulator.
